### Distributed Networked File System
[https://github.com/HumairaAZ/Distributed-File-System](docs/README.md)

This project showcases my experience in implementing and benchmarking a basic distributed networked file system in C++. It includes detailed documentation and performance results.

### Results
The benchmarks provide insights into the performance of the distributed file system operations, which can be used to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
